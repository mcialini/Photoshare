This is a non-live photosharing web application I created for my Databases course. It consists of several java files used to pull files and user information from a database, then jsp files (html and java combined) to handle site organization and user interaction.

Photoshare provided functionality to create Albums, Images, Comments, and User accounts. Registered users are able to become friends with other users, and upload albums and pictures. Nonregistered and registered users are both able to post comments and like pictures. It also allows visitors to search all the pictures on the site using a tag system. Users are able to tag photos with as many keywords as they'd like, thus permitting the search of specific kinds of photos.
